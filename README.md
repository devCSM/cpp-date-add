# cpp-date-add

This is a console application which gives the user two options

1. Ender a new date
2. Add a fixed number of days to the current date

If the user selects the first option, the program will respond with:

- Whether or not it is a leap year
- How many days have passed in the given year up to that date
- How many days are left in the given year from that date

If the user selects the second option, the program will respond with the date entered in the first option + the number of days entered in the second option.
